# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

That's a relief that I did not have to write the whole code myself. There were too many things to do nevertheless. That was very challenging to control every stage of my work.

## Stop Doing

<!--
  what did your group do that did not go very well
  agree to stop doing this in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - pushing changes directly to master/main branch
  - claiming more issues at once than you can finish
-->

- Do not divide work on the same user story on branches.
- Working in few branches at the same time.

## Continue Doing

<!--
  what did your group that worked well
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->

- Divide the work on branches based on functionality (or user story).
- Focus on one branch at a time.
- Write file system of the branch file by file.
- Using milestones to mark global stages of work.

## Start Doing

<!--
  what ideas does your group have for making a better project next time?
  agree to give these things a try in the next projec
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - use @mentions more often
  - use the github integration in slack. /github
-->

- Reviewing code locally by running CI tests.

## Lessons Learned

<!--
  what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?
  This can be about anything! code, collaboration, git, github, ...
-->

- The workflow of writing code in separate branches and documents.
- Every branch should work separately.
- Continuous Integration (CI).
- **Delete `cd` error** can be fixed by changing CRLF to LF.
